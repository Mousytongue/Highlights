## Multi-user AR Illusion

Multi-user AR experience using Augmented Space Library. 
Uses ARCore / Google Cloud Anchor / Augmented Space Library / Unity

This project is a technical exploration in creating an AR illusion of the physical world changing. Uses a screen capture with multiple texture projectors to produce an visual effect of the surface opening up into a pitfall. Created as a mutliuser AR app to test the ASL library's capabilities.
